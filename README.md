# ccbrief

A minimal, configurable **status line for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** — one small
Node process that turns the session JSON Claude Code hands it into a tidy, colorful status line.

> **Not affiliated with, or endorsed by, Anthropic.** ccbrief is an independent, open-source project
> that reads the data Claude Code already exposes. It makes no network calls and collects no telemetry.

```
🌿 ccbrief/main +3/-1 │ 42% ━━━━───── │ ⏱ 1h 24m │ Opus
```

<sub>Examples in this README are shown without color; in your terminal the context bar, git diff, and
rate-limit warnings are color-coded.</sub>

## Quick start

```sh
npx ccbrief init
```

That one command:

- copies a self-contained renderer into `~/.claude/ccbrief/`,
- backs up your existing `~/.claude/settings.json`,
- merges in the `statusLine` block (leaving the rest of your settings untouched),
- and is **idempotent** — safe to run again anytime.

Claude Code picks up the new status line on its next render. That's it — no config file to hand-edit,
no shell plumbing.

> Prefer to see it first? `npx ccbrief config` opens an interactive picker with a live preview before
> you install anything.

## Presets

Pick a preset in the config TUI, or set `"preset"` in the config file. Every preset **hides any segment
whose data isn't available yet** — so early in a session, or right after `/compact`, you'll simply see
fewer segments rather than fake zeros.

**Minimal** — repo · context · model

```
🌿 ccbrief/main +3/-1 │ 42% ━━━━───── │ Opus
```

**Standard** _(default)_ — repo · context · duration · model

```
🌿 ccbrief/main +3/-1 │ 42% ━━━━───── │ ⏱ 1h 24m │ Opus
```

**Detailed** — directory · repo · lines · context · tokens · duration · cost · rate limits · effort · model

```
ccbrief │ 🌿 ccbrief/feat/layout +8/-2 │ 73% ━━━━━━━── │ 170k │ ⏱ 2h 30m │ $4.56 │ 5h 40% · 2h 0m
7d 12% · reset due │ ⚡ high │ Opus
```

When a line is too wide for your terminal, ccbrief packs complete segments across up to three rows
(it never splits a segment). Narrow the window and the Detailed line above simply reflows:

```
ccbrief │ 🌿 ccbrief/feat/layout +8/-2 │ 73% ━━━━━━━──
170k │ ⏱ 2h 30m │ $4.56 │ 5h 40% · 2h 0m
7d 12% · reset due │ ⚡ high │ Opus
```

## Features

- **Hide, don't fake.** If a source value is null — context % and rate limits are null early on and
  after `/compact` — the segment is omitted. ccbrief never renders a fabricated `0%`.
- **Layout that fits.** Segments are measured (emoji/CJK counted as 2 columns, ANSI colors as 0) and
  packed into **≤ 3 rows** against your terminal width. No terminal-wrapping surprises; a single
  oversized segment is truncated with `…` rather than split.
- **Zero runtime dependencies.** The installed renderer is bundled and fully self-contained — **no
  `jq`, no network calls, no telemetry, and no `postinstall` script.** Install happens only when you
  explicitly run `npx ccbrief init`.
- **Cross-platform.** macOS, Linux, WSL, and Windows are all first-class.
- **Clickable PRs.** The PR segment links to the pull request via terminal hyperlinks (OSC 8).
- **Swappable glyphs.** Emoji icons (default) or a pure-ASCII fallback.

## Configuration

Open the interactive TUI to toggle segments, reorder them, switch presets, and preview live:

```sh
npx ccbrief config
```

Settings are stored at `~/.claude/ccbrief/config.json` (override the base directory with the
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable). The file is optional — a missing or malformed config falls
back to sensible defaults and never breaks the status line.

| Key | Values | Default | What it does |
|-----|--------|---------|--------------|
| `preset` | `minimal` · `standard` · `detailed` · `custom` | `standard` | Named segment set. `custom` uses your `segments` list. |
| `layout` | `auto` · `single-line` · `multi-line` | `auto` | How segments are packed into rows. |
| `maxRows` | `1`–`3` | `3` | Maximum rows the status line may occupy. |
| `glyphs` | `emoji` · `nerd-font` · `ascii` | `emoji` | Icon style. |
| `colors` | `true` · `false` | `true` | ANSI color output. |
| `icons` | `true` · `false` | `true` | Show segment icons/glyphs. |
| `segments` | `[{ "id", "enabled" }]` | — | Ordered segment list (used when `preset` is `custom`). |

### Glyph styles

Emoji (default) shows icons and renders everywhere; `ascii` is a safe, icon-free fallback for
terminals with limited glyph support. (A `nerd-font` value is also accepted, but currently renders the
emoji layout — `│` separators and `━`/`─` bar — without icons.)

```
emoji:  ccbrief │ 🌿 ccbrief/feat/layout +8/-2 │ 73% ━━━━━━━── │ 170k │ ⏱ 2h 30m │ $4.56
ascii:  ccbrief | ccbrief/feat/layout +8/-2 | 73% #######-- | 170k | 2h 30m | $4.56
```

## Segments

Every segment hides automatically when its source field is absent, so you only ever see live data.

### Core

| Segment | Shows | Hidden when |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `directory` | Current directory name | No workspace directory |
| `repo` | Repo/branch + staged diff (`+3/-1`) | Not in a git repo |
| `context` | Context window used %, with a bar | Null early in a session / after `/compact` |
| `model` | Active model name | Absent |

### Usage

| Segment | Shows | Hidden when |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `tokens` | Tokens in context (e.g. `170k`) | Before the first response / after `/compact` |
| `remaining` | Context percent remaining (`58% left`) | Null |
| `duration` | Session wall-clock (`⏱ 1h 24m`) | Absent |
| `cost` | Session cost (`$1.23`) | Absent |
| `fiveHour` | 5-hour rate-limit window (`5h 40% · 2h 0m`) | Not on Pro/Max |
| `weekly` | 7-day rate-limit window (`7d 12% · reset due`) | Not on Pro/Max |

### Development

| Segment | Shows | Hidden when |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `lines` | Session lines added/removed (`+120/-34`) | Absent |
| `pr` | PR number + review state (clickable) | No associated PR |
| `worktree` | Active git worktree name | Not in a worktree |

### Claude

| Segment | Shows | Hidden when |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `effort` | Reasoning effort level (`⚡ high`) | Absent |
| `thinking` | Thinking indicator (`🧠 thinking`) | Thinking not enabled |
| `outputStyle` | Output style name (`concise`) | Absent |
| `agent` | Active subagent name | No active subagent |

## How it works

Claude Code spawns a fresh process per status-line update, pipes the session JSON on **stdin**, and
captures **stdout** as the status line. ccbrief is that process: one Node start, one JSON parse — a
single self-contained script that replaces the traditional bash-and-many-`jq`-spawns approach.

The renderer reads terminal width from the `COLUMNS` environment variable (output is captured, so there
is no TTY to query) and falls back to 80 columns when it's unset. It refreshes on Claude Code's events,
and every 60s only when a time-based segment (duration or a rate-limit window) is enabled.

## Platform support

| Platform | Supported |
|----------|-----------|
| macOS | ✅ |
| Linux | ✅ |
| WSL | ✅ |
| Windows | ✅ |

Requires **Node ≥ 22**. CI runs the full test suite on Node 22 and 24 across macOS, Linux, and Windows.

---

## Uninstall

```sh
npx ccbrief uninstall
```

Restores your backed-up `settings.json` if one exists, or otherwise strips only the `statusLine` block
that ccbrief added. It asks whether to also remove the `~/.claude/ccbrief/` renderer directory.

---

## Development

```sh
npm test           # run the test suite (node --test)
npm run build      # bundle the renderer with esbuild → dist/statusline.js
```
